Mini-Boss is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model and Auto-GPT (https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT). 
This program, driven by Auto-GPT on top of GPT-4, chains together LLM "thoughts", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Mini-Boss pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

## ⚠️ Limitations

This experiment aims to showcase the potential of management for autonomous Auto-GPT agents utilizing GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

1. Not a polished application or product, just an experiment
2. May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!
3. Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!
