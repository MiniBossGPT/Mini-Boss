        ‚ö†Ô∏è SUPER-busy repo, please help the volunteer maintainers.
        The less time we spend here, the more time we spend building AutoGPT.

        Please help us help you:
        - Does it work on current `main` (https://github.com/MiniBossGPT/Mini-Boss/tree/main)?
        - Search for existing issues, "add comment" is tidier than "new issue"
        - Provide relevant info:
          - Provide commit-hash (`git rev-parse HEAD` gets it)
          - If it's a pip/packages issue, provide pip version, python version
          - If it's a crash, provide traceback.
